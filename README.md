# Be³ Network  
**Be here. Be free. Be gone.**

Aim: Proof of Presence.
A network that breathes when you do.  
Every open app is a heartbeat —  
every moment of awareness fuels the chain.

No mining farms. No background loops.  Only presence → energy → release.

Core Idea  
When you open Be³, you warm the network.  
Your device becomes a living node —  
validating vibes, routing ghosts, witnessing dissolutions.  
Close it, and it dissolves — leaving only proof you were real.

Not Proof of Work. Not Proof of Stake. Proof of Presence.

Essence  
Zero servers. Zero surveillance.  
Lightweight mesh — local, ephemeral, self-erasing.  
Tokens born from time spent alive: *BREATHS* or *SPARKS*.  
Earned by presence, decayed by time, capped by meaning.

Philosophy  
Be³ is not social media. It’s a social moment.  
It remembers nothing except that we were here —  
together — for a while.
